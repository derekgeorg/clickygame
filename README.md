##### Project Link: (https://derekgeorg.github.io/clickygame/)

The Clicky Game is a simple memory game created with React.

When the app loads, four separate images are shown and the Score is set to 0.

Click an image. They then shuffle randomly. If you go through all the images without selecting any of them twice, you win! An the score goes up by one. 

You can keep playing until you select the same image twice. At that time, the game resets but saves your Top Score.

### Learned:
* Breaking up application's UI into components
* Manage component state
* Respond to user events
* Shuffling images randomly
